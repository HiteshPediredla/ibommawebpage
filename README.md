2.Navigation and Layout: Implemented a user-friendly navigation system, including a header, footer, and intuitive menu structure, mimicking the original website's layout.

3.Styling and Theming: Used CSS to meticulously style and theme the clone, closely matching the color scheme, fonts, and aesthetic elements of ibomma.

4.Cross-Browser Compatibility: Tested the clone on multiple web browsers to ensure consistent performance and appearance across different platforms.
